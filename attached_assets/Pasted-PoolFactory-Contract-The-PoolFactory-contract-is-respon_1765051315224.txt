PoolFactory Contract
The PoolFactory contract is responsible for creating and managing all liquidity pools in the DEX.

Contract Address
0x34A0b64a88BBd4Bf6Acba8a0Ff8F27c8aDD67E9C
Purpose
The Factory pattern ensures:

One Pool Per Pair: Only one pool exists for each token pair
Consistent Pool Creation: All pools use the same contract template
Easy Discovery: Query all pools or find a specific pool
Key Functions
createPool
Creates a new liquidity pool for a token pair.

function createPool(address tokenA, address tokenB) external returns (address pool)
Parameters:

tokenA: Address of first token
tokenB: Address of second token
Returns: Address of the created pool

How it works:

1. Validates tokens are different and not zero address

2. Sorts tokens by address (token0 < token1)

3. Checks pool doesn't already exist

4. Deploys new SimplePoolWithLP contract

5. Stores pool address in mapping (both directions)

6. Adds to allPools array

7. Emits PoolCreated event

Important Notes:

Pools are created automatically when first liquidity is added
Token order is normalized (lower address = token0)
Pool address is stored in both directions for easy lookup
getPool
Gets the pool address for a token pair.

function getPool(address tokenA, address tokenB) external view returns (address pool)
Parameters:

tokenA: Address of first token
tokenB: Address of second token
Returns: Pool address (address(0) if pool doesn't exist)

Example:

address usdcPool = factory.getPool(USDC, SRAC);
if (usdcPool != address(0)) {
    // Pool exists, can swap
}
allPoolsLength
Gets the total number of pools created.

function allPoolsLength() external view returns (uint256)
Returns: Total number of pools

allPools
Array containing all pool addresses. Can be accessed with index:

address pool = factory.allPools(0);  // First pool
Storage Structure
mapping(address => mapping(address => address)) public pools;  // token0 => token1 => pool
address[] public allPools;  // All pool addresses
The mapping stores pools with normalized token order, and also stores the reverse mapping for convenience.

Events
PoolCreated(address indexed tokenA, address indexed tokenB, address pool, uint256): Emitted when a new pool is created
Usage Example
// Create a new pool
address newPool = factory.createPool(USDC, SRAC);

// Check if pool exists
address pool = factory.getPool(USDC, SRAC);
require(pool != address(0), "Pool not found");

// Get total pools
uint256 totalPools = factory.allPoolsLength();
